The three algorithms Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Randomized Quick Sort has been implemented.
The program is written using Python programming language (Python 2.7) which can be executed using terminal.
The program takes  <Filename>.txt and number of items to be sorted file as the inputs.
The <Filename>.txt should contain the items listed one below the other in the following manner.

10  <item 1>
2    <item 2>
56   <item 3>
-1    <item 4>
10   <item 5>

Code file is IQR.py

To run the program the following command formate should be used.
 python IQR.py <Filename>.txt <Number of items to be sorted>

The program will ask for choose an algorithm.
             Input 1 for Insertion Sort
             Input 2 for Quick Sort
             Input 3 for Randomized Quick Sort 

The output gives the execution time and the sorted list in this format.
<Sorted list>
<Number of items> <Execution time in seconds>
 


NOTE:- 
Don't leave a blank space at the end of the file, the program will take null character.
Remember to give correct <Number of items to be sorted>
An example input1.txt file containing 50 items (random,repeated,positive,negative) is sent.
A python file randG.py is available to generate randome numbers in specified range
